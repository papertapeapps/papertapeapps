    For each card in the app's tarot deck, you can upload your own images, edit the title, write your own description, and take notes on each card. You may also remove cards and create new cards. 
<br><br>
There is additional space to save and organize miscellaneous tarot-related items as well. You can upload spread ideas, artwork, notes, etc. and you can tag related tarot cards for easy referencing.
<br><br>
Making this app simple, easy-to-use, and non exploitative was our highest priority. As for data privacy, no data is collected from the app and all the information you upload is saved locally only to your device. There are also no subscription fees or paid premium versions, the app is a one-time purchase. Additionally, there are no progress bars, point systems, levels, etc. We want to be respectful of your tarot practice and avoid gamifying it, and instead simply provide a useful tool. <br><br>
