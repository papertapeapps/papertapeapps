❝ As a tarot practitioner of many years, I struggled to find an app that aligned with my tarot practice. Most apps center around referencing pre-written card definitions, and I absolutely think there is value in that. However in my experience, as people progress in their practice they accumulate personal experiences with the cards that they prefer to reference over pre-written definitions. I know for myself, I end up writing my thoughts in a bunch of random places - in a physical notebook, on my notes app, or sometimes I forgot to write them down at all. So I wanted an app where I could centralize my thoughts and experiences and be able to reference them easily. 
<br><br>
Over time I’ve also screenshotted so many tarot spread ideas, or saved them across multiple apps and those always get lost in the digital abyss. I have a hard time remembering them or finding them when the time comes that I want to do a tarot spread. And I’ve also done so many tarot readings that I just have a random picture of them in my camera roll and I wish I wrote down the purpose of the spread and insights I had. 
<br><br>
So I created paper tape tarot! the app is meant to serve as a personal tarot guidebook that you can completely customize: you can write your own card definitions, change card names, upload your own card photos, add or remove cards from the deck, and take notes on each card. There is also a “saved” page to organize any personal miscellaneous tarot related things like spread ideas, notes, images, artwork, etc. And you can export your tarot deck and saved items to a PDF at any time to print them out or just keep it in your files as a backup!
<br><br>
As a woman software engineer with a background in human-computer interaction it was also really important to me to make the type of technology I hope to see in the world - technology that is simple and nonexploitative. Nothing about the app is gamified, there are no points, progress bars, levels, etc…. which was extremely important to me because I wanted this app to be a useful tool that is respectful of your tarot practice and doesn’t mine your time or attention. Your data is also completely private and saved only on your device, none of it is collected and sold or shared. 
<br><br>
There are also no ads or subscription fees or paid premium versions - the app will be a one time purchase of $4.99.*
<br><br>
I worked on paper tape tarot for a very long time, it is truly a labor of love that I hope is as useful to others as I have found it to be. ❞
